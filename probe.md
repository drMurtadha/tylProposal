# Problem Background

The use of fingerprint detection technology on smartphones has become increasingly essential since it enables secure and convenient access control for a wide range of applications, from unlocking devices to authorizing financial transactions. As mobile banking, e-commerce, and digital identity verification become more prevalent, the need for fast, reliable, and secure fingerprint recognition has never been greater. As a result of factors such as sensor wear, environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, dust), user variability (e.g., fingerprint wear, aging), and power limitations of mobile devices, fingerprint detection remains challenging. Although optical and capacitive fingerprint sensors are widely used, their accuracy and speed are often limited by external and internal factors. Therefore, user experience and security can be compromised, since slow or failed detections can lead to frustration, security risks, and vulnerabilities for unauthorized access.

Recent developments in fingerprint detection, such as ultrasonic sensors and machine learning-enhanced recognition algorithms, offer promising improvements in handling complex scenarios such as partial fingerprints, damaged ridges, and poor environmental conditions. These solutions, however, come with their own set of challenges, such as higher computational demands, higher costs, and higher battery consumption. In order to meet smartphone users' demands for faster, more reliable fingerprint authentication without compromising battery life, it is imperative to optimize these technologies in order to optimize their performance and efficiency. In order to resolve this issue, it is necessary to analyze existing fingerprint detection methods in order to identify areas where detection speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency can be improved. Using these challenges as a focus, this research aims to develop more advanced, more resilient, and more user-friendly fingerprint detection solutions tailored to the evolving requirements of modern smartphone applications.
