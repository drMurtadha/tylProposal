# Statement of Problem 
The rapid advancement of smartphone technology has resulted in fingerprint recognition becoming an essential feature for the enhancement of security and convenience. However, traditional fingerprint detection methods often have limitations in terms of accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency, particularly when dealing with wet or dry fingers, worn-out sensors, and complex usage patterns. As a result of these limitations, fingerprint detection methods that are more effective and robust are needed to ensure user experience and security. Analyzing and evaluating fingerprint detection methods for smartphones, with a focus on maximizing detection efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability across diverse application scenarios, is the goal of this study. The purpose of this research is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current fingerprint detection approaches in order to develop enhanced fingerprint detection solutions that offer improved performance and reliability, ultimately resulting in more secure and user-friendly smartphone apps.
